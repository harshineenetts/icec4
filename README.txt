Project Title : Connect Four Game

Description:
The Connect Four Game Project is a Python implementation of the classic Connect Four board game. Players take turns dropping their tokens (X or O) into a vertical grid, aiming to connect four tokens consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal. The project showcases fundamental programming concepts and provides a foundation for further enhancements, such as graphical interfaces and AI opponents.

Specifications:

i) Game Board:

The game board is a 2D grid with a default size of 6 rows and 7 columns.
The grid is represented using a 2D list, initialized with empty spaces (' ').

ii) Functionality:

Players take turns, starting with player X, to choose a column for their token to be dropped.
Tokens fall to the lowest available empty space in the selected column.
The game checks for win conditions after each player's move:
Four consecutive tokens in a row.
Four consecutive tokens in a column.
Four consecutive tokens in a diagonal.
The game ends with a victory for one of the players or a draw when the grid is completely filled.

iii) User Interface:

The game is played through the terminal.
The current state of the game board is displayed after each move.
Players are prompted to enter a valid column number (0 to 6) to drop their token.

iv) Error Handling:

Input validation is implemented to ensure players choose valid columns.
Handling of a completely filled column to prevent invalid moves.

v) Win and Draw Detection:

The game checks for win conditions after each player's move using a function (check_win).
It determines if a player has connected four tokens in a row, column, or diagonal.

vi) Player Alternation:

The game alternates between players X and O after each successful move.

vii) Project Extension Ideas:

Graphical Interface: Enhance the user experience by creating a graphical interface using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter.
AI Opponent: Develop an AI opponent using algorithms like minimax or alpha-beta pruning for single-player mode.
Network Multiplayer: Implement networking capabilities to allow players to compete against each other over the internet.
Customization: Allow customization of grid size, token symbols, and victory conditions.

viii) Key Learning Points:

Game mechanics and turn-based logic.
Input validation and error handling.
Two-dimensional list manipulation.
Win condition checks for rows, columns, and diagonals.
Basic terminal-based user interface.
Project Outcome:
The Connect Four Game Project provides a hands-on learning experience in programming concepts and game development. It demonstrates a foundational understanding of Python, user interaction, and logical problem-solving. By extending the project, developers can showcase their creativity and skills in creating dynamic and engaging gaming experiences.
